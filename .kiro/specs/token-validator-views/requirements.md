# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Token Validator plugin with a three-view interface system that provides a streamlined user experience for design token validation. The system includes a form view for configuration, a results view for displaying validation outcomes, and a collapsed view for focused element inspection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to configure validation parameters in a dedicated form view, so that I can specify exactly what design token issues to check for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN the system SHALL display the form view by default
2. WHEN the form view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show design system attachment options
3. WHEN the form view is displayed THEN the system SHALL require the user to select a design system before validation
4. WHEN the form view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show checkboxes for validation options (spacings, corner radius, font size, font color)
5. WHEN the form view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Run Check" button
6. WHEN no design system is selected THEN the system SHALL disable the "Run Check" button or show an error message
7. WHEN the user clicks "Run Check" THEN the system SHALL validate that a design system is attached
8. WHEN the user clicks "Run Check" AND a design system is attached THEN the system SHALL transition to the results view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to view validation results in a dedicated results view, so that I can see all design token issues in an organized format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL display the results view
2. WHEN the results view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a summary of issues found
3. WHEN the results view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a list of all validation issues
4. WHEN the results view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Back to Form" button
5. WHEN the user clicks "Back to Form" THEN the system SHALL return to the form view with previous settings preserved
6. WHEN the user clicks on a specific issue THEN the system SHALL transition to the collapsed view
7. WHEN an issue is clicked THEN the system SHALL select the corresponding element in Figma
8. WHEN an issue is clicked THEN the system SHALL position the viewport to show the selected element

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a collapsed view when inspecting specific elements, so that I can focus on the selected element without the UI taking up too much screen space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a validation issue THEN the system SHALL display the collapsed view
2. WHEN the collapsed view is displayed THEN the system SHALL show only a single "Token Validator" button
3. WHEN the collapsed view is displayed THEN the system SHALL resize the plugin window to minimal dimensions
4. WHEN the user clicks the "Token Validator" button in collapsed view THEN the system SHALL return to the results view
5. WHEN returning from collapsed view THEN the system SHALL restore the previous window size
6. WHEN returning from collapsed view THEN the system SHALL maintain the current validation results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer, I want smooth transitions between views, so that the interface feels responsive and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between views THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the transition
2. WHEN transitioning between views THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and selections
3. WHEN transitioning to collapsed view THEN the system SHALL animate the window resize
4. WHEN transitioning from collapsed view THEN the system SHALL restore the previous view state
5. WHEN validation is running THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without losing user input

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer, I want the plugin to remember my settings between sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure the same parameters repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user attaches a design system THEN the system SHALL persist the selection
2. WHEN the user selects validation options THEN the system SHALL remember the choices for the next session
3. WHEN the plugin is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous design system attachment
4. WHEN the plugin is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous validation option selections
5. WHEN the user changes settings THEN the system SHALL automatically save the new preferences

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a designer, I want clear navigation between views, so that I always know where I am and how to get back to previous screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in any view THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators of the current view state
2. WHEN navigation options are available THEN the system SHALL make them clearly visible and accessible
3. WHEN the user can go back THEN the system SHALL provide a clear "Back" or return mechanism
4. WHEN the user is in the collapsed view THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to return to the full interface
5. WHEN view transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain logical navigation flow
